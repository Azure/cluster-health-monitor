# Change imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent for local testing purposes. Using `imagePullPolicy: Always` forces the image to be pulled from a
# remote registry. This does not exist because a locally built image is used in this scenario. IfNotPresent allows the local image to be 
# used, thus allowing the test to proceed. If we would rather not do this, an alternate approach could be to use KIND local registries 
# https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/.
